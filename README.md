# besucherparken-hamburg
Small application to get a parking ticket for the German city of Hamburg's Besucherparken service more easily.
This is really just a proof-of-concept, used by me personally. 
It does not do any complex input verification and is prone to break when the Besucherparken website changes.

Tech: C#, Selenium
